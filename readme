## Description 
      
This app generates a readme in seconds, based on the user's responses, to save time and effort in readme generation. I developed this application to simplify the process for myself and others. During its development, I encountered several challenges that helped me learn and grow. One of the most memorable challenges was figuring out how to make the license badges appear correctly. Additionally, moving my code to a separate file, 'generateMarkdown.js,' was an important step in organizing the project. One of the most memorable challenges was figuring out how to make the license badges appear correctly. To resolve these issues, I made sure that 'licenseBadges' was correctly exported as an object and aligned with the selected license. Implementing the 'or' statement to return an empty string when 'None' was selected simplified this process. In the end, I was able to achieve my goals while improving my programming skills and vocabulary.

## Usage

This app allows you to generate a readme in seconds, eliminating the need to create or copy the layout manually. With this app, you'll have your readme ready quickly and effortlessly. You can open your terminal and navigate to the 'readme-generator' directory using the 'cd' command, or you can right-click on 'index.js' and select 'Integrated Terminal,' which is the faster method. Then, type 'node index.js.' A series of questions will appear, and you can answer them. Once you've completed the last question, the readme file will be generated in a matter of seconds.
